# Portfolio
Introduction
This project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase an individual's profile, skills, services, certificates, and provide a contact form for visitors to get in touch. The website features a modern, dark-themed design with smooth scrolling navigation, fixed header, and responsive form inputs. It emphasizes user experience with clear navigation highlighting and form validation before submission.
The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on clean layout structure, stylish visual elements, and interactive behavior such as active menu highlighting on scroll and client-side form validation.

## üéØ Features
- Fixed Header Navigation:
The header remains visible at the top of the page while scrolling. It contains navigation links that smoothly scroll to different sections of the site.
- Active Menu Highlighting:
As the user scrolls through sections, the corresponding navigation link highlights automatically to indicate the current section in view.
- Responsive and Stylish Layout:
The site uses flexible widths and floats to create multi-column layouts for different content areas like skills, certificates, and services.
- Dark Themed Design:
Uses a black background with warm orange and yellow accents (#ff9c00, #ffbf35) to create a visually appealing contrast and modern look.
- Contact Form with Client-side Validation:
The form ensures all fields (name, email, phone, message) are filled before allowing submission, preventing incomplete data from being sent.
- Smooth Scroll Behavior:
Clicking on navigation links smoothly scrolls to the targeted page section.
- CSS Progress Bars and Circular Indicators:
Skills are displayed with horizontal progress bars and circular progress indicators for visual representation of proficiency.
- Hover Effects on Navigation and Buttons:
Navigation links and buttons change color on hover for interactive feedback.
- Multi-Section Layout:
Supports sections such as banner, about, skills, services, certificates, and contact.
- Mobile-Friendly Adjustments:
Media queries adjust form layout and font sizes for smaller screens for better usability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow
- Design & Structure:
Define the page layout with semantic HTML elements, dividing the site into meaningful sections (header, section, footer, etc.). Use CSS to style the elements, create responsive layouts, and add visual effects.
- Navigation & Interactivity:
Implement JavaScript to handle smooth scrolling navigation and dynamically highlight the active section in the menu as the user scrolls.
- Form Handling:
Add JavaScript validation to ensure all required contact form fields are completed before submission. Prevent default form submission and show user-friendly alerts.
- Testing & Responsiveness:
Test the website on different screen sizes and browsers. Adjust CSS for smaller devices to ensure usability and appearance.
- Deployment:
Once finalized, deploy the website on a hosting platform or personal server to make it accessible online.
