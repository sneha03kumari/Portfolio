## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow
- Design & Structure:
Define the page layout with semantic HTML elements, dividing the site into meaningful sections (header, section, footer, etc.). Use CSS to style the elements, create responsive layouts, and add visual effects.
- Navigation & Interactivity:
Implement JavaScript to handle smooth scrolling navigation and dynamically highlight the active section in the menu as the user scrolls.
- Form Handling:
Add JavaScript validation to ensure all required contact form fields are completed before submission. Prevent default form submission and show user-friendly alerts.
- Testing & Responsiveness:
Test the website on different screen sizes and browsers. Adjust CSS for smaller devices to ensure usability and appearance.
